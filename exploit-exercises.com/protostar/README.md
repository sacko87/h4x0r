Protostar

Introducing memory corruption in Linux/x86.

About
---
[Protostar][] introduces the following in a friendly way:

* Network programming
    * Byte order
    * Handling sockets
* Stack overflows
* Format strings
* Heap overflows

The above is introduced in a simple way, starting with simple memory corruption
and modification, function redirection, and finally executing custom shellcode.

In order to make this as easy as possible to introduce Address Space Layout
Randomisation and Non-Executable memory has been disabled. If you are
interested in covering ASLR and NX memory, please see the [Fusion][] page.
