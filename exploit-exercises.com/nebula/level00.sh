# important part:
#  look in root for files with the suid flag set
#   find / -perm +4000
#  notice and run /bin/.../flag00
# additional extras (to get it to run in one command):
#  ignore errors sent to stderr (permissions, etc)
#   2> /dev/null
#  filter out the file we want from it
#   | grep flag00
#  run it using backticks
