Nebula
===
Introducing local privilege escalation in Linux.

About
---
Nebula takes the participant through a variety of common (and less than common) weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Linux. It takes a look at:

* SUID files
* Permissions
* Race conditions
* Shell meta-variables
* $PATH weaknesses
* Scripting language weaknesses
* Binary compilation failures

At the end of Nebula, the user will have a reasonably thorough understanding of local attacks against Linux systems, and a cursory look at some of the remote attacks that are possible.
